# NHS Super Face Mask Clip and Visor

During lockdown due to Covid19, I printed over 50 face mask visors and face mask clips which were donated to local care homes and hospitals. PPE was in short supply in the early stages of lockdown so these donations helped fill the demand.

## Face Visor
These visors are made up from a 3D printed frame which goes around the users head. A poly sheet is then clipped onto the visor to add an extra layer of cover for the user's face. <i>*Note I did not design this file, there was a standard CAD file being used all around the world to produce these visors.</i>

## NHS Face Mask Clip
A lot of the masks provided to essential workers had elastic straps. During long shifts these straps can cause strain on the user's ears. The purpose of the face clips is to hold the mask to the user's face without putting strain on the ears. These were customised to include the NHS logo but have the standard 'S' replaced with Superman's symbol as a tribute to the heroic job these essential workers were doing during the pandemic
